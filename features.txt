Language:
- variable names (r for register and m for memory):   #name r8 variable_name
- comments: //comment here
- sudo instructions:
    CMP A B == SUB A B 0
- lables: .lable1 (JMP/BRH .lable1 will jump the first instruction after where the lable is defined)
- BRH conditions: (C Z)
    00, 01, 10, 11
    ==, !=, >=, <
    0, 1, 2, 3

Assembler:
1. remove comments and empty lines
2. replace variable names with their respective register/memory addresses
3. replace sudo instructions
4. replace BRH conditions with integer values
5. calculate lable indexes
6. assemble
